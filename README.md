# GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

This README.md shows an overview of this repository which contains objects 
to show how a raw data set can be transformed into a tidy
data set which can be used for analysis.

The R script (run_analysis.R) does all the processes to 
prepare a tidy data set. 

For information and guide to the R script, the codebook (CodeBook.md) is 
included. It contains information on the data, variables, transformation, and steps
in the analysis.

The output (data_tidy.txt) of the R script is also provided for 
additional analysis.
